Titanic-passengers-survival-prediction

Hello everyone it's a Machine learning and Data analysis project In this project we are analyse and classifier best model using Logistic Regression and support vector machine.
In this project , we  build a predictive model that answers the question: 

“what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” 
using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Steps Performed in my project:

1. Import dataset using kaggle api 
2. import important library 
3. Read in csv file and 
4. Data visualization
5. remove duplicate value and file Miss value 
6. cupping outlier
6. create train, test and validation data frames
7. Create the train_gen, test_gen final_test_gen and valid_gen
8. Exploratory Data Analysis
9. Data Preprocessing Feature Engineering
10. Create a model using LogsticRegration 
11. test over model accuracy score and confirm matrix
